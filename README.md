# REACT FOOD

## Description:
REACT FOOD is a personal project I developed from scratch, including design in Figma and front-end implementation in ReactJS. The project uses MockAPI for server-side interaction and Redux Toolkit (RTK) for state management. Features include responsive design, Axios for data handling, BEM + SCSS architecture, an interactive Swiper slider, Lodash for data optimization, and ClassNames for styling. The app is fully responsive and optimized for various devices.
